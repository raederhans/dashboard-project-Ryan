# Control Panel Specification

- Use Map: toggles selection mode; when active, cursor is a crosshair and the next map click sets buffer A center.
- Radius: 400 m or 800 m; affects buffer A queries (points, charts, compare), not district choropleth.
- Time Window: start month + duration (3/6/12/24 months). Presets for “Last 6m/12m”.
- Offense: multi-select groups with a live-audited drilldown list of codes. If drilldown is empty, groups control filtering; if populated, exact codes are used.
- Admin Level: Districts vs Tracts. Rate toggle switches between counts and per‑10k (tracts only).
